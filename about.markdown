Phones have turned out to be an integral part of our day-to-day lives even though they were initially used for just sending messages and placing calls. They are far more advanced these days, allowing you to save all kinds of personal and non-personal information. For example, you might capture your favorite moments from that one-day trip to the nearby waterfalls, a picture of a restaurant that you want to try out another time, some important official documents, your resume, the research papers you have been reading, your must-read list of ebooks, the list goes on! Before you know it, your phone is flooded with images, videos, screenshots, documents, etc. and you are struggling to find something in particular. Itâ€™s like searching for a needle in a haystack. ARK Navigator helps you in this situation by allowing you to browse your files through an easy-to-use interface designed particularly to tackle situations like this. It allows you to add tags to your files and retrieve them easily using the tags. You can be as creative as you want with the tagging system. For example, you could mark your ebooks as read/unread, fiction/non-fiction, based on the author's name, etc. You could mark videos as watched/unwatched, short film/movie/documentary/etc., personal/public, etc.
